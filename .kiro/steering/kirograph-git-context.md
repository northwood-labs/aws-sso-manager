# KiroGraph: Git Context Workflow

Use this workflow for pre-commit reviews, PR descriptions, and understanding what changed.

## 1. before committing — understand what you changed

```text
kirograph_diff_context()              // unstaged — see what's touched
kirograph_diff_context(staged: true)  // staged — final check before commit
```

This shows changed symbols, their callers (who might break), and their callees (what they call).

## 2. build commit message context

```text
kirograph_commit_context()
```

Returns staged files, diff stat, and affected symbols. Feed into commit message generation.

## 3. check test coverage for changed symbols

```text
kirograph_test_map()                          // all symbols with no test coverage
kirograph_test_map(symbol: "<changed fn>")    // tests for a specific symbol
```

## 4. PR description

```text
kirograph_pr_context(base: "main", head: "HEAD")
```

Returns symbols added/removed/changed between refs. Use as structured context for PR summary.

## 5. coverage report (if lcov/Istanbul files exist)

```text
kirograph_test_coverage()                    // worst-covered files first
kirograph_test_coverage(sortBy: "desc")      // best-covered files first
```
